I find it very interesting to work on diverse C++ applications. The thrill of creating various softwares makes me deeply satisfied and fulfilled. The synergy work of the analytical and creative parts of my cerebral cortex suddenly become perfectly matched, together with the sound logic flow, to smoothly design server applications.

*I usually write codes on my Macbook. Oh I remember, I still need to find C++ stickers to vandal my Mac.*

Aside from physics, coding is my next favorite hobby especially when it comes to creating systems applications for embedded devices, crunching data with Python and writing technical static web pages with Javascript.
