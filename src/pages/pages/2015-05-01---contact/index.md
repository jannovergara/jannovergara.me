"The best way to look back at life fondly is to meet it - and those along your journey - warmly, kindly and mindfully.‚Äù
-- Rasheed Ogunlaru 

It's always a great experience to meet people who share the same **passion** as you do. I am based in Makati, Philippines. Great coding or tech stories are best shared over beer or coffee. Feel free to ping!
