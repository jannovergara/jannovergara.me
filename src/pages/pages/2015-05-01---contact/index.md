"The best way to look back at life fondly is to meet it - and those along your journey - warmly, kindly and mindfully.‚Äù
-- Rasheed Ogunlaru 

It's always a great experience to meet people who share the same **passion** as you do. I am based in Makati, Philippines. If you're somewhere near that area, feel free to ping! Great coding, tech stories and urban legends are best shared over beer or coffee.
