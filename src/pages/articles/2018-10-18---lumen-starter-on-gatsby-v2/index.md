Thanks to
[lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) template, initiated
by the folks at [Gatsby Central](https://www.gatsbycentral.com/). This website has been fast, nice and easy to work with.

Web development is not my niche, but credits to the hardworking Gatsby web developers this site becomes possible.
