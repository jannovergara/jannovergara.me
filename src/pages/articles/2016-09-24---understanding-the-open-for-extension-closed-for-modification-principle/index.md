Software elements e.g. classes, modules, functions, etc. should be open for extension, but closed for modification. The design and writing of the code should be done in a way that new functionality should be added with minimum changes in the existing code.

The concept may seem really easy, however, one may find that this is the type of design to be practiced with repetition much like any other advanced development task.
