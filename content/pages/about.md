I find it very interesting to work on diverse C++ applications. The thrill of creating various software projects make me feel deeply satisfied and fulfilled. The synergy work of the analytical and creative parts of my cerebral cortex become perfectly matched, together with the sound logic flow, to smoothly design client, server and database applications. Often you see me working likely as below:

*I usually write codes on my Macbook. It's a classic mid-2012 Mac but still serves me well. Help me find C++ stickers for it!*

Aside from physics, coding is my next favorite hobby especially when it comes to creating systems applications for embedded devices, crunching data with Python and writing technical static web pages with Javascript.

There's a new development in my career over the past few months. I now work as a solutions architect for a telecom company which includes designing, implementing and innovating on cloud solutions and enterprise architectures. A good grasp of software engineering principles and project management coupled with a healthy experience on AWS cloud technologies allowed me to take the role.

These days are full of meetings and planning.
